The <a
 href="http://developer.mitre.org/projects/giscore" target="_blank"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">giscore</span></a> package provides the capability to perform streaming
 input and output of data from GIS representation file formats, such as ESRI Shapefiles or geo-databases (GDB),
 and Google Earth KML.  <em>giscore</em> is a standalone Java library that uses StAX (STreaming Api for Xml processing)
 to process XML an element at a time rather than read entire document into memory in a DOM-like structure.
The geometric classes include points, lines, rings, polygons and provide all the validation
needed to enforce the integrity of a valid geometric representation.
<P/>
A KmlReader class transparently handles KML and compressed KMZ files by file or URL along with fetching all NetworkLinks.
Likewise, a KmlWriter class handles creation of KML or KMZ files and optionally allowing adding other files
as entries in the KMZ (ZIP) file. All versions of KML specifications are imported so don't need to restrict to the latest
OGC KML 2.2 spec or the older 2.1 and 2.0 specifications which have some incompatibilities.
Some deprecated and removed features from older KML specs are implemented to support importing of legacy KML data,
but the export creates KML against the KML 2.2 so some deprecated/deleted features may not be preserved on output
without some conversion. The API takes care of most dirty details.
<P/>
While some fine-grain customization may be lost in translation (e.g. KML regions, models,
ballon styles, etc.), the basic geospatial and temporal data is preserved in a common representation.
The feature structure can be exported to these standard formats once the common representation 
is created programmically or imported from an existing source.
<P/>
This package uses the <a 
href="http://developer.mitre.org/projects/gis-geodesy" target="_blank">geodesy</a>
package as a core implementation of 2D and 3D points, arcs, ellipses, and bounding boxes in
an earth-oriented spatial reference system.
<P/>
Some test ESRI shape and KML files for countries of the world (circa 2002) are
available <a
 href="http://picard.mitre.org/TransFusion/dat/Countries_2002/" target="_blank">here</a>
in addition to the ones provides in the distribution in the data directory.
