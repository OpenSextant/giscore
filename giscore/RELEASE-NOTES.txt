------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.5.23

This release primarily introduces enhancenments and minor bug-fixes to KML input/output
and some underlying XML handling.

General
  * Added ListStyle support to Style/KmlOutputStream/KmlInputStream
  * Update geodesy 1.9.14 using short-cut from Geodetic2DPoint.getLatitude().inDegrees()
    to Geodetic2DPoint.getLatitudeAsDegrees().
  * Add @Nullable/@CheckForNull annotations to methods in GroundOverlay, Overlay, Style, etc.
  * Added getEncoding() to XmlInputStream, KmlInputStream, KmlReader so output stream can have
    correct character encoding if not UTF-8 used

Common
  * Fix setStyleUrl() to auto-fix the url if relative idref and '#' not first character

GISFactory
  * Added encoding (String) as first argument to KML + KMZ type in getOutputStream()
    so can match correct character encoding

KmzOutputStream
  * Added public KmzOutputStream(OutputStream stream, String encoding) constructor

XmlGdbOutputStream
  * Update close() and close streams in finally block to close even if exception thrown

GroundOverlay
  * Added setBoundingBox(Geodetic2DBounds box) to set overlay bounding box from Geodetic2DBounds

Style
  * Change double to Double and boolean to Boolean in field types and associated getters/setters to allow Nullable values.

UrlRef
  * Update User-Agent to Google Earth 5.2 identifier
  * Add new methods: isIdentifier(), isXMLNameCharacter(), isXMLNameStartCharacter()
  * Updated escapeUri() to handle ascii control chars 00-2f and extended 7f-ff

Release 0.5.24

This release primarily introduces cleanup and bug-fixes to KML input/output and some underlying XML handling.

Fixed bug in KmlWriter that did not close all image entries in created KMZ file
creating corrupt ZIP file. Added flag to underlying KmlOutputStream/XmlOutputStreamBase classes.

StyleMap
-add containsKey() method + added NORMAL/HIGHLIGHT constants

KmlInputStream
-Updated StyleMap handling

UrlRef

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.5.25

This release fixes minor bugs in KML input/output, Schema, and Polygon point handling.

Polygon
-fix getPoints(). failed if points in "wrong" order.
 Puts outer ring points in clockwise order and inner ring points in ccw order

KmlInputStream
-fix interpreting kml elements as non-kml/foreign elements if kml root element does not declare explicit kml namespace

KmlOutputStream
-Properly escape schema id value in output

UrlRef
-updated isIdentifier() to allow %HH URI-escaping
-added isHexDegit()

Schema
-Update setName() to normalize name value stripping leading/trailing whitespace and not allow blank strings as valid

KmlMetaDump.java
-Add check for suspicious Schema id/name characters to enforce Schema id/name constraints
