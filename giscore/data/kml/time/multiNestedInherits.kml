Timestamps on nested Features.

Child placemarks "inherit" time from each of its parent containers.

As of Google Earth 5.0 the following rule applied:
In order for a feature to be visible, all of its ancestors must be visible
and that feature must be visible given visibility flags and temporal
conditions up the chain to top-most feature.

As of Google Earth 5.1 the following rule applies:
The value of time elements shall be inherited by all Feature members of
a hierarchy unless overruled by the presence of such elements locally.

Example shows how temporal visibility is inherited.

	[2    .   4] 			timespan of outer-most container
[1       .    .   .     .    6] 	timespan of placemark #1
	[2    .   4] 			effective temporal visilbity of placemark #1 (**)
             [3   .     5]		timespan of inner-most container
[1       .    .   .     .    6] 	timespan of placemark #2
             [3   4]        		effective temporal visilbity of placemark #2 (**)

** As of Google Earth 5.1 the local times of features define the time that
   feature is visible. Prior to Google Earth 5.1 the visibility of features
   was affected by the time of its ancestors.
