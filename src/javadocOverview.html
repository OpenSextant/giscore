The <a
 href="http://developer.mitre.org/projects/giscore" target="_blank"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">GIScore</span></a> package provides the capability to perform streaming
 input and output of data from GIS representation file formats, such as ESRI Shapefiles or geo-databases (GDB),
Google Earth <a href="http://mitrepedia.mitre.org/index.php/KML" target="_blank">KML</a>/KMZ, and GeoRSS.
<em>GIScore</em> is a standalone Java library that uses StAX (STreaming Api for XML processing)
to process XML an element at a time rather than read entire document into memory in
a DOM-like structure. Some non-XML formats such as CSV are supported as well. The
geometric classes include points, lines, rings, polygons and provide all the
validation needed to enforce the integrity of a valid geometric representation.

<blockquote>
A <em>KmlReader</em> class transparently handles KML and compressed KMZ files by file or URL
along with fetching all NetworkLinks. Likewise, a KmlWriter class handles creation of KML or
KMZ files and optionally allowing adding other files as entries in the KMZ (ZIP) file. All
versions of KML specifications are imported so don't need to convert older 2.0 and 2.1
KML documents into the latest <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/"
 target="_blank">OGC KML 2.2</a> spec. The API takes care of most dirty details.
For example, all valid forms of time are handled including some lax forms that do
not conform to XML Schema validation yet are allowed by Google Earth.
<P/>
While some deprecated and removed features from older KML specs are implemented to support importing
of legacy KML data, the export creates KML conforming to KML 2.2 so some deprecated/deleted features
may not be preserved on output without some manual intervention. For example having the <em>parent</em> element
or attribute in Schema element is correctly handled in import in that aliased elements are converted to
Placemarks to be valid KML but the metadata is not auto-converted to <em>ExtendedData</em> fields.
<P/>
Some fine-grain customization may be lost in a few cases (e.g. KML regions, models,
NetworkLinkControls, <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html#kmlextensions"
 target="_blank">gx extensions</a>, etc.), the core geospatial and temporal data is
preserved in a common representation. The feature structure can be exported to
these standard formats once the common representation is created programmically
or imported from an existing source.

This package uses the <a 
href="http://developer.mitre.org/projects/gis-geodesy" target="_blank">geodesy</a>
package as a core implementation of 2D and 3D points, arcs, ellipses, and bounding boxes in
an earth-oriented spatial reference system.
<P/>
Some test ESRI shape and KML files for countries of the world (circa 2002) are
available <a
 href="http://picard.mitre.org/TransFusion/dat/Countries_2002/" target="_blank">here</a>
in addition to the ones provides in the distribution in the data directory.
